## Branch description

This branch follows the main branch but adds the interface to the [MOPAC-ML wrapper](https://github.com/Honza-R/mopac-ml), which provides the machine learning correction for PM6-ML calculations. Information on how to run the calculations is provided there; this branch of MOPAC provides just the executable that MOPAC-ML depends on.

For more information on MOPAC and instructions on compilation, see the README of the [main](https://github.com/Honza-R/mopac) branch.
